Smart City Transportation Network Optimization 🚦🌆
Course: CSE112 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms
Institution: Alamein International University
Objective: Optimize Greater Cairo's transportation network using graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and greedy approaches to address traffic congestion, emergency routing, and public transit efficiency.

Key Features
Graph-Based Modeling: Weighted graph representation of Cairo’s road network with temporal traffic data.

Algorithm Implementations:

Shortest Path: Dijkstra’s (standard routing) + A* (emergency vehicles) + time-dependent variants.

MST Algorithms: Kruskal’s/Prim’s for cost-efficient road network design.

Dynamic Programming: Public transit scheduling + road maintenance allocation.

Greedy Methods: Traffic signal optimization + emergency vehicle prioritization.

Simulations & Visualizations: GUI to demonstrate route optimizations, congestion reduction, and emergency response scenarios.

Deliverables
📁 Code: Modular Python implementation (core/algorithms/ for Dijkstra, A*, MST, etc.).
📄 Technical Report: Complexity analysis, design decisions, and performance evaluations.
🎥 Demo: Interactive scenarios showcasing algorithm efficacy.
